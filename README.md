# Bank_Management_system

Its a simple project that I made for my UG course- "Programming And DataStructures".

It is completely built in c language.

It uses Linked List data structure.

Operations: 
- create and delete your account 
- edit your account details such as name, phone number, etc
- deposit money to your account 
- withdraw from your account 
- transfer money to another account
